-added + and - buttons
-hooked + button to backend where when clicked:
    1. prompt for new person's name ("who you know")
    2. create that person in the backend
    3. create a connection to them from the current user
-to hook to backend:
    1. added ConnectionController, ConnectionRepo, and Connection model
    Problem face:
        1. spring security blocked the frontend from accessing endpoints
        2. source and target (ConnectionModel) were sent as full objects and Spring boot couldnt deserialize
           no visual link appeared even with proper backend return
    Solution:
        1. global CORS config
        2. createConnection in ConnectionController
            -send only sourceID and targetId
            -uses Map<String, Long> body
           update frontend onAdd (App.jsx) to send just IDs

-refactored App.jsx into separate files
    1. GraphCanvas.jsx (main graph rendering and logic)
    2. GraphDisplay.jsx (responsible only for rendering the graph using ForceGraph2D)
    3. GraphTitle.jsx (top blue bar title)
    4. ButtonPanel.jsx (add/remove buttons)
    5. OverlayInput.jsx (custom input overlay replacing browser's prompt for a more consistent UI)
-moved all API calls to features/api.js to keep API logic separate from UI logic.
    1. fetchPeopleAndConnections
    2. createPerson
    3. createConnection
    4. deleteConnection
    5. deletePersonByName
-backend update to support delete connection and person frontend feature
-improved ui/ux:
    when user clicks add/remove:
        1. The graph dims.
        2. Overlay appears with input.
        3. Upon submit/cancel, returns to graph view
