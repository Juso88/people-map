-added + and - buttons
-hooked + button to backend where when clicked:
    1. prompt for new person's name ("who you know")
    2. create that person in the backend
    3. create a connection to them from the current user
-to hook to backend:
    1. added ConnectionController, ConnectionRepo, and Connection model
    Problem face:
        1. spring security blocked the frontend from accessing endpoints
        2. source and target (ConnectionModel) were sent as full objects and Spring boot couldnt deserialize
           no visual link appeared even with proper backend return
    Solution:
        1. global CORS config
        2. createConnection in ConnectionController
            -send only sourceID and targetId
            -uses Map<String, Long> body
           update frontend onAdd (App.jsx) to send just IDs

-refactored App.jsx into separate files
    1. GraphCanvas.jsx (main graph rendering and logic)
    2. GraphDisplay.jsx (responsible only for rendering the graph using ForceGraph2D)
    3. GraphTitle.jsx (top blue bar title)
    4. ButtonPanel.jsx (add/remove buttons)
    5. OverlayInput.jsx (custom input overlay replacing browser's prompt for a more consistent UI)
-moved all API calls to features/api.js to keep API logic separate from UI logic.
    1. fetchPeopleAndConnections
    2. createPerson
    3. createConnection
    4. deleteConnection
    5. deletePersonByName
-backend update to support delete connection and person frontend feature
-improved ui/ux:
    when user clicks add/remove:
        1. The graph dims.
        2. Overlay appears with input.
        3. Upon submit/cancel, returns to graph view

- add description to people
- add infobox
    displays user information
- change connection mappings to OneToOne
    one to many doesn't make any sense becasue that means each link is going from multiple source ids to one single target. 
    This would make sense if we keep track of connections inside of the people class but that's more work.
- add update code paths
    currently user can't update things just yet but working on it
- change nodes id to be actual ids from database
    this was blocking a lot of things but it turned out to be a really simple fix
    now we can easily make sure we add, update, and remove the right things
- add icons to buttons
- add more buttons
- add more api endpoints + matching functions
- made input overlay box more extendable
TODO: 
fix infobox
fix multi selection
implement new connection button
