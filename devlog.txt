-added + and - buttons
-hooked + button to backend where when clicked:
    1. prompt for new person's name ("who you know")
    2. create that person in the backend
    3. create a connection to them from the current user
-to hook to backend:
    1. added ConnectionController, ConnectionRepo, and Connection model
    Problem face:
        1. spring security blocked the frontend from accessing endpoints
        2. source and target (ConnectionModel) were sent as full objects and Spring boot couldnt deserialize
           no visual link appeared even with proper backend return
    Solution:
        1. global CORS config
        2. createConnection in ConnectionController
            -send only sourceID and targetId
            -uses Map<String, Long> body
           update frontend onAdd (App.jsx) to send just IDs
